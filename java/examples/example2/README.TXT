Generating Meeting Point Application Proxies.
---------------------------------------------

This example generates proxy code for the "Meeting Point" application.

Load the "ConfigJavaExample2.xml" file into ProxyGen and generate the proxies.
Then use "build.bat" to build the main proxy.

The generated Java files are in uk\co\luminary\proxygen\examples\ which you may
want to view.
